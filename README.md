# About me
- 👋 Hihi there, I’m @yaotingsun 孙耀庭. Currently, I‘m a postdoc in the @Mann_lab at the Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry. I got my phd degree from Zhejiang University and Westlake University (@Guomics_lab) and majored in clinical proteomics.
  
- 👀 I’m highly interested in spatial proteomics ([Deep visual proteomics, DVP](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01302-5)) and mass spectrometry technologies, especially in targeted proteomics. I'm dedicated to applying mass spectrometry techniques to the discovery of clinical disease biomarkers, serving the diagnosis and treatment of clinical patients, and advancing the translation of mass spectrometry-based proteomics to the clinic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning best practices in spatial data analysis and proteomics methodology development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and discuss on clinical/biological image analysis.
- 📫 How to reach me working email ysunATbiochem.mpg.de and private email yaotingsun1991ATgmail.com.
